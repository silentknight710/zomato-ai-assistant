# -----------------------
# Dependencies for the Zomato RAG Chatbot project.
# It is strongly recommended to pin package versions using '=='
# to ensure reproducibility across different environments.
#
# To get your current working versions, run:
#   pip freeze > current_versions.txt
# Then copy the relevant package versions from 'current_versions.txt'
# and replace the '==X.Y.Z' placeholders below.
# Example: transformers==4.38.2
# -----------------------

# --- Core AI/ML Libraries ---
sentence-transformers==X.Y.Z  # For generating text embeddings
transformers==X.Y.Z          # Foundational library for models (used by sentence-transformers, pipelines)
torch==X.Y.Z                 # Deep learning framework (PyTorch) - Ensure version compatibility!
# torchvision==X.Y.Z         # Often installed with torch, include if used implicitly/explicitly
# torchaudio==X.Y.Z          # Often installed with torch, include if used implicitly/explicitly

# --- Vector Database ---
pinecone==X.Y.Z              # Pinecone client library (the newer package name)

# --- Hugging Face Hub Interaction (Optional but recommended) ---
huggingface_hub==X.Y.Z       # For downloading models, potentially logging in

# --- Utilities ---
python-dotenv==X.Y.Z         # For loading environment variables from .env file

# --- Web Scraping (Required for Assignment - Add your choices) ---
# Choose libraries based on your scraper implementation in scraper.py
# requests==X.Y.Z              # For making HTTP requests
# beautifulsoup4==X.Y.Z        # For parsing HTML
# lxml==X.Y.Z                  # Often used as a parser with BeautifulSoup
# Or, if using Scrapy framework:
# scrapy==X.Y.Z

# Add any other specific libraries your project uses below
# e.g., pandas==X.Y.Z (if you used it for data handling)
